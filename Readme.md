Wayback Machine is solely designed to store web pages across the Internet. Saving any URL to Wayback Machine is pretty easy.

Go to http://web.archive.org/.
Enter the target URL in the “Save Page Now” box and click on “Save Page”.
That’s it guys. Now your desired web page is permanently stored on Wayback.
Pros: With Wayback Machine, you can also check historical data of any web page.
All you need to do is enter the URL into the search bar and you will get a complete timeline of the web versions.
Cons: The process is completely manual. There is also no guarantee for the stability of archived content. Results 
are not nearly as accurate as a full-page screenshot. Lastly, there is no support provided.

Despite a few flaws, we all love Wayback Machine for the contributions it has made to the Internet.
